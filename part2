Test the smart contract: After writing the smart contract, test it on a testnet blockchain to make sure it works as intended and fix any errors that may occur.

Deploy the smart contract: Once the smart contract is tested and ready, deploy it to the mainnet blockchain so that people can start using it. This will typically require paying a fee in the blockchain's native currency.

Distribute the tokens: After deploying the smart contract, you can distribute the tokens to the people who are going to use them.
